            We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premiums. We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature. We identify the best-performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowing nonlinear predictor interactions missed by other methods. All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals, a set that includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.

We show that they are very much interrelated and explore the relationships in detail. Among other things, we show that (1) volatility dependence produces sign dependence, so long as expected returns are nonzero, so that one should expect sign dependence, given the overwhelming evidence of volatility dependence; (2) it is statistically possible to have sign dependence without conditional mean dependence; (3) sign dependence is not likely to be found via analysis of sign autocorrelations, runs tests, or traditional market timing tests because of the special nonlinear nature of sign dependence, so that traditional market timing tests are best viewed as tests for sign dependence arising from variation in expected returns rather than from variation in volatility or higher moments; (4) sign dependence is not likely to be found in very high-frequency (e.g., daily) or very low-frequency (e.g., annual) returns; instead, it is more likely to be found at intermediate return horizons; and (5) the link between volatility dependence and sign dependence remains intact in conditionally non-Gaussian environments, for example, with time-varying conditional skewness and/or kurtosis.},

abstract={We estimate the conditional distribution of trade-to-trade price changes using ordered probit, a statistical model for discrete random variables. This approach recognizes that transaction price changes occur in discrete increments, typically eighths of a dollar, and occur at irregularly-spaced time intervals. Unlike existing models of discrete transactions prices, ordered probit can quantify the effects of other economic variables like volume, past price changes, and the time between trades on price changes. Using 1988 transactions data for over 100 randomly chosen U.S. stocks, we estimate the ordered probit model via maximum likelihood and use the parameter estimates to measure several transaction-related quantities, such as the price impact of trades of a given size, the tendency towards price reversals from one transaction to the next, and the empirical significance of price discreteness}

abstract={Despite abundant research which focuses on estimating the level of return on stock market index, there is a lack of studies examining the predictability of the direction/sign of stock index movement. Given the notion that a prediction with little forecast error does not necessarily translate into capital gain, we evaluate the efficacy of several multivariate classification techniques relative to a group of level estimation approaches. Specifically, we conduct time series comparisons between the two types of models on the basis of forecast performance and investment return. The tested classification models, which predict direction based on probability, include linear discriminant analysis, logit, probit, and probabilistic neural network. On the other hand, the level estimation counterparts, which forecast the level, are exponential smoothing, multivariate transfer function, vector autoregression with Kalman filter, and multilayered feedforward neural network. Our comparative study also measures the relative strength of these models with respect to the trading profit generated by their forecasts. To facilitate more effective trading, we develop a set of threshold trading rules driven by the probabilities estimated by the classification models. Empirical experimentation suggests that the classification models outperform the level estimation models in terms of predicting the direction of the stock market movement and maximizing returns from investment trading. Further, investment returns are enhanced by the adoption of the threshold trading rules.}

We extend the deﬁnition to the case of more than two classes by averaging pairwise comparisons. This measure reduces to the standard form in the two class case. We compare its properties with the standard measure of proportion correct and an alternative deﬁnition of proportion correct based on pairwise comparison of classes for a simple artiﬁcial case and illustrate its application on eight data sets. On the data sets we examined, the measures produced similar, but not identical results, reﬂecting the different aspects of performance that they were measuring.

The stock market is the archetypal example, which in most developed economies captures a lot of attention and resources. Is the stock market just a sideshow or does it affect real economic activity? In this review, we discuss the potential real effects of financial markets that stem from the informational role of market prices. We review the theoretical literature and show that accounting for the feedback effect from market prices to the real economy significantly changes our understanding of the price formation process, the informativeness of the price, and speculators’ trading behavior. We make two main points. First, we argue that a new definition of price efficiency is needed to account for the extent to which prices reflect information that is useful for the efficiency of real decisions (rather than the extent to which they forecast future cash flows). Second, incorporating the feedback effect into models of financial markets can explain various market phenomena that otherwise seem puzzling. Finally, we review empirical evidence on the real effects of secondary financial markets.},

	title = {Price {Discovery} in {High} {Resolution}},
	abstract = {U.S. equity market data are currently timestamped to nanosecond precision. This permits models of price dynamics at resolutions sufﬁcient to capture the reactions of the fastest agents. Direct estimation of multivariate time series models at submillisecond frequencies nevertheless poses substantial challenges. To facilitate such analyses, this paper applies long distributed lag models, computations that take advantage of the inherent sparsity of price transitions, and bridged modeling. At resolutions ranging from 1 s down to 10 ls, I estimate representative models for two stocks (IBM and NVDA) bearing on three topics of current interest. The ﬁrst analysis examines the extent to which the conventional source of market data (the consolidated tape) accurately reﬂects the prices observed by agents who subscribe (at additional cost) to direct exchange feeds. At a 1-s resolution, the information share of the direct feeds is indistinguishable from that of the consolidated tape. At resolutions of 100 and 10 ls, however, the direct feeds are totally dominant, and the consolidated share approaches zero. The second analysis examines the quotes from the primary listing exchange vs. the non-listing exchanges. Here, too, information shares that are essentially indeterminate at 1-s resolution become much more distinct at higher resolutions. Although listing exchanges execute about one-ﬁfth of the trading volume, their information shares are slightly above one-half. The third analysis examines quotes, lit trades, and dark trades. At a 1-s resolution, dark trades appear to have a small, but discernible, information contribution. This vanishes at higher resolutions. Quotes and lit trades essentially account for all price discovery, with information shares of roughly 65\% and 35\%, respectively.},

In this paper, I investigate the implications of these changes for high frequency market microstructure (HFT). I describe the new high frequency world, with a particular focus on how HFT affects the strategies of traders and markets. I discuss some of the gaps that arise when thinking about microstructure research issues in the high frequency world. I suggest that, like everything else in the markets, research must also change to reflect the new realities of the high frequency world. I propose some topics for this new research agenda in high frequency market microstructure.},

	abstract = {What explains stock market behavior in the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic? Estimates from a dynamic asset pricing model point to wild fluctuations in the pricing of stock market risk, driven by shifts in risk aversion or sentiment. We find further evidence that the Federal Reserve played a role in these fluctuations, via a series of announcements outlining unprecedented steps to provide several trillion dollars in loans to support the economy. As of July 31 of 2020, however, only a tiny fraction of the credit that the central bank announced it stood ready to provide in early April had been extended, reinforcing the conclusion that market movements during COVID-19 have been more reflective of sentiment than substance.},

The closure of the trading floor led to reductions in liquidity, price efficiency, and informed trading on the NYSE, and its subsequent reopening led to increases in these variables. The effects of the pandemic and the trading floor on price efficiency can be explained, at least in part, by their impacts on liquidity and informed trading. The effects on liquidity and price efficiency are fully reversed after the NYSE reopened its trading floor.},

abstract="The historical perspective provided in chapter 1 on the decades leading up to the financial crisis shows that the global economy was by no means as stable as had been suggested by many observers. That said, the crisis was largely unexpected and due to its complex roots, it continued to puzzle policymakers, economists and other commentators as it unravelled and sucked in at first banks and companies, and then economies across the globe. The collapse in the real economy has had devastating consequences for households as a result of rising unemployment and surging poverty. At the same time, some countries have been affected more than others as a result of differences in initial conditions (state of economy, labour market, fiscal space, institutional framework) and exposure to direct and indirect impact of the crisis via credit and trade channels.",
