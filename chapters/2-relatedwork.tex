{\bfseries Stock Price Movement Predictability}

The quest to determine whether the stock returns are predictable or not is an open matter in the financial econometric literature. \citet{rapach_forecasting_2013} survey time-series regression models with different indicators to forecast US equity premium. These models show weak stock returns predictability. More recently, machine learning approaches are receiving attention, though their performance is still a long way to be significant. One recent study by \citet{kelly_virtue_2024} shows theoretical support for complex and large machine learning models. A comparative study by \citet{gu_empirical_2020} suggests that neural network and regression trees are the best performing models to predict asset risk premiums.
