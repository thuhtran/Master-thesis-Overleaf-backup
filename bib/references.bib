Assuming that the observed stock prices are continuously monitored, an estimator is constructed using the notion of how quickly the price changes rather than how much the price changes. It is shown that this estimator has desirable asymptotic properties, including consistency and asymptotic normality. Also, through a simulation study, the authors show that it outperforms natural estimators for the low- and middle-priced stocks. Furthermore, the simulation study demonstrates that the proposed estimator is robust to certain misspecifications in measuring the time between price changes.},

Overall 1/16th and 1/24th range of the dependent variable is better explained by trading-related explanatory variables than 1/8th range of the dependent variable for small ﬁrms and there is not much difference in large ﬁrms among three decimals. The results imply that ﬁner speciﬁcation in decimalization and smaller ﬁrm size matters in trading after the decimalization project.},

We show that they are very much interrelated and explore the relationships in detail. Among other things, we show that (1) volatility dependence produces sign dependence, so long as expected returns are nonzero, so that one should expect sign dependence, given the overwhelming evidence of volatility dependence; (2) it is statistically possible to have sign dependence without conditional mean dependence; (3) sign dependence is not likely to be found via analysis of sign autocorrelations, runs tests, or traditional market timing tests because of the special nonlinear nature of sign dependence, so that traditional market timing tests are best viewed as tests for sign dependence arising from variation in expected returns rather than from variation in volatility or higher moments; (4) sign dependence is not likely to be found in very high-frequency (e.g., daily) or very low-frequency (e.g., annual) returns; instead, it is more likely to be found at intermediate return horizons; and (5) the link between volatility dependence and sign dependence remains intact in conditionally non-Gaussian environments, for example, with time-varying conditional skewness and/or kurtosis.},

            We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premiums. We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature. We identify the best-performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowing nonlinear predictor interactions missed by other methods. All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals, a set that includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.

The out-of-sample analysis suggests that the four probit models with the proposed risk factors can generate more accurate forecasts for the duration of recessions than the conventional static models with only yield spread and equity price index as the predictors. Among the four probit models, the dynamic and dynamic autoregressive probit models outperform the static and autoregressive models in terms of predicting the recession duration.

            We investigate lead‐lag relationships among monthly country stock returns and identify a leading role for the United States: lagged U.S. returns significantly predict returns in numerous non‐U.S. industrialized countries, while lagged non‐U.S. returns display limited predictive ability with respect to U.S. returns. We estimate a news‐diffusion model, and the results indicate that return shocks arising in the United States are only fully reflected in equity prices outside of the United States with a lag, consistent with a gradual information diffusion explanation of the predictive power of lagged U.S. returns.},

We show that they are very much interrelated and explore the relationships in detail. Among other things, we show that (1) volatility dependence produces sign dependence, so long as expected returns are nonzero, so that one should expect sign dependence, given the overwhelming evidence of volatility dependence; (2) it is statistically possible to have sign dependence without conditional mean dependence; (3) sign dependence is not likely to be found via analysis of sign autocorrelations, runs tests, or traditional market timing tests because of the special nonlinear nature of sign dependence, so that traditional market timing tests are best viewed as tests for sign dependence arising from variation in expected returns rather than from variation in volatility or higher moments; (4) sign dependence is not likely to be found in very high-frequency (e.g., daily) or very low-frequency (e.g., annual) returns; instead, it is more likely to be found at intermediate return horizons; and (5) the link between volatility dependence and sign dependence remains intact in conditionally non-Gaussian environments, for example, with time-varying conditional skewness and/or kurtosis.},

A better understanding of the needs of XAI users, as well as human-centered evaluations of explainable models are both a necessity and a challenge. In this paper, we explore how human-computer interaction (HCI) and AI researchers conduct user studies in XAI applications based on a systematic literature review. After identifying and thoroughly analyzing 97 core papers with human-based XAI evaluations over the past ﬁve years, we categorize them along the measured characteristics of explanatory methods, namely trust, understanding, usability, and human-AI collaboration performance. Our research shows that XAI is spreading more rapidly in certain application domains, such as recommender systems than in others, but that user evaluations are still rather sparse and incorporate hardly any insights from cognitive or social sciences. Based on a comprehensive discussion of best practices, i.e., common models, design choices, and measures in user studies, we propose practical guidelines on designing and conducting user studies for XAI researchers and practitioners. Lastly, this survey also highlights several open research directions, particularly linking psychological science and human-centered XAI.},

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of XAI research in IS in general and electronic markets in particular using a structured literature review. Based on a literature search resulting in 180 research papers, this work provides an overview of the most receptive outlets, the development of the academic discussion, and the most relevant underlying concepts and methodologies. Furthermore, eight research areas with varying maturity in electronic markets are carved out. Finally, directions for a research agenda of XAI in IS are presented.},

In the realm of user-centric XAI, research efforts focus on XAI approaches that specifically address users’ needs for interpretability. In the ultimate consequence, explanations must be individually tailored to each individual user’s needs. Against this background, we propose a novel approach to personalize automatically generated explanations along AI decisions. In a given context with given objectives of explanations, our XAI Personalization Approach automatically adjusts the hyperparameters of an XAI method for individual users. The approach processes individual user interaction data based on contextual bandits to increase the effectiveness of resulting explanations. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach and evaluate its efficacy in a user study with the task of image classification. Results suggest that explanations personalized by our approach are more effective than one-size-fits-all user-centric explanations.},

The process can be applied independent of the XAI method, application domain, and target user group. It incorporates the principles of usercentric design, insights into explanations from the social sciences, and established XAI evaluation scenarios.

	abstract = {The increasing usage of complex Machine Learning models for decision-making has raised interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In this work, we focus on the effects of providing accessible and useful explanations to non-expert users. More specifically, we propose generic XAI design principles for contextualizing and allowing the exploration of explanations based on local feature importance. To evaluate the effectiveness of these principles for improving users’ objective understanding and satisfaction, we conduct a controlled user study with 80 participants using 4 different versions of our XAI system, in the context of an insurance scenario. Our results show that the contextualization principles we propose significantly improve user’s satisfaction and is close to have a significant impact on user’s objective understanding. They also show that the exploration principles we propose improve user’s satisfaction. On the other hand, the interaction of these principles does not appear to bring improvement on both dimensions of users’ understanding.},

	abstract = {In attempts to “explain” predictions of machine learning models, researchers have proposed hundreds of techniques for attributing predictions to features that are deemed important. While these attributions are often claimed to hold the potential to improve human “understanding” of the models, surprisingly little work explicitly evaluates progress towards this aspiration. In this paper, we conduct a crowdsourcing study, where participants interact with deception detection models that have been trained to distinguish between genuine and fake hotel reviews. They are challenged both to simulate the model on fresh reviews, and to edit reviews with the goal of lowering the probability of the originally predicted class. Successful manipulations would lead to an adversarial example. During the training (but not the test) phase, input spans are highlighted to communicate salience. Through our evaluation, we observe that for a linear bag-of-words model, participants with access to the feature coefﬁcients during training are able to cause a larger reduction in model conﬁdence in the testing phase when compared to the no-explanation control. For the BERT-based classiﬁer, popular local explanations do not improve their ability to reduce the model conﬁdence over the no-explanation case. Remarkably, when the explanation for the BERT model is given by the (global) attributions of a linear model trained to imitate the BERT model, people can effectively manipulate the model.},

Researchers have proposed ways to automatically produce interpretations for deep neural network models. However, it is unclear how useful these interpretations are in helping users ﬁgure out why they are getting an error. If an interpretation effectively explains to users how the underlying deep neural network model works, people who were presented with the interpretation should be better at predicting the model’s outputs than those who were not. This paper presents an investigation on whether or not showing machine-generated visual interpretations helps users understand the incorrectly predicted labels produced by image classiﬁers. We showed the images and the correct labels to 150 online crowd workers and asked them to select the incorrectly predicted labels with or without showing them the machine-generated visual interpretations. The results demonstrated that displaying the visual interpretations did not increase, but rather decreased, the average guessing accuracy by roughly 10\%.},

	abstract = {Explaining the decisions of an Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) model is increasingly critical in many real-world, high-stake applications. Hundreds of papers have either proposed new feature attribution methods, discussed or harnessed these tools in their work. However, despite humans being the target end-users, most attribution methods were only evaluated on proxy automatic-evaluation metrics [60, 78, 80]. In this paper, we conduct the ﬁrst user study to measure attribution map effectiveness in assisting humans in ImageNet classiﬁcation and Stanford Dogs ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation, and when an image is natural or adversarial (i.e. contains adversarial perturbations). Overall, feature attribution is surprisingly not more effective than showing humans nearest training-set examples. On a harder task of ﬁne-grained dog categorization, presenting attribution maps to humans does not help, but instead hurts the performance of human-AI teams compared to AI alone. Importantly, we found automatic attribution-map evaluation measures to correlate poorly with the actual human-AI team performance. Our ﬁndings encourage the community to rigorously test their methods on the downstream human-in-the-loop applications and to rethink the existing evaluation metrics.},

	abstract = {The use of conversational agents (CAs) based on artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more common in the field of recruiting. Organizations are now adopting AI-based CAs for applicant (pre-)selection, but negative news coverage, especially the black-box character of AI, has hindered adoption. So far, little is known about the contextual factors influencing users’ perception of AI-based CAs in general and the effect of provided explanations by explainable AI (XAI) in particular. While research on algorithm aversion provides some initial explanations, information regarding the effects of different XAI approaches on different types of decisions on the attitudes of (potential) applicants is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we use a quantitative, quota-representative study (n = 490) to assess the acceptance of CAs in recruiting. By applying an experimental within-subject design, we provide a more nuanced perspective on why and when providing explanations increases user acceptance. We also show that contextual factors such as the type of assessed skills are major determinants of this effect, and we conclude that XAI is not a “one-size-fits-all approach.” Based on the insight that contextual factors of the decision problem are more important than the type of XAI approach itself, we argue that the use and the effects of explainability in recruiting need a more nuanced perspective, focusing on the fit of explanations with the user’s characteristics and preferences.},

Building upon the theory of trust, we propose a model that hypothesizes that post hoc explainability (using Shapley Additive Explanations) has a significant impact on use-related variables in this context. To test our model, we designed an experiment using a randomized controlled trial design where participants compare signatures and detect forged signatures. Surprisingly, our study shows that XAI only has a small but significant impact on perceived explainability. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that a high level of perceived explainability has a strong impact on important constructs including trust and perceived usefulness. A post hoc analysis shows that hedonic factors are significantly related to perceived explainability and require more attention in future research.

The insecurity rises the need for equipping the algorithms with explanations. To examine how users trust automated DSS, an experiment was conducted. Our research aim is to examine how participants supported by an DSS revise their initial prediction by four varying approaches (treatments) in a between-subject design study. The four treatments differ in the degree of explainability to understand the predictions of the system. First we used an interpretable regression model, second a Random Forest (considered to be a black box [BB]), third the BB with a local explanation and last the BB with a global explanation. We noticed that all participants improved their predictions after receiving an advice whether it was a complete BB or an BB with an explanation. The major finding was that interpretable models were not incorporated more in the decision process than BB models or BB models with explanations.},

	abstract = {Background:  Artificial Intelligence has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, and it is increasingly being deployed to support and assist medical diagnosis. One potential application of AI is as the first point of contact for patients, replacing initial diagnoses prior to sending a patient to a specialist, allowing health care professionals to focus on more challenging and critical aspects of treatment. But for AI systems to succeed in this role, it will not be enough for them to merely provide accurate diagnoses and predictions. In addition, it will need to provide explanations (both to physicians and patients) about why the diagnoses are made. Without this, accurate and correct diagnoses and treatments might otherwise be ignored or rejected.
Method:  It is important to evaluate the effectiveness of these explanations and understand the relative effectiveness of different kinds of explanations. In this paper, we examine this problem across two simulation experiments. For the first experiment, we tested a re-diagnosis scenario to understand the effect of local and global explanations. In a second simulation experiment, we implemented different forms of explanation in a similar diagnosis scenario.
Results:  Results show that explanation helps improve satisfaction measures during the critical re-diagnosis period but had little effect before re-diagnosis (when initial treatment was taking place) or after (when an alternate diagnosis resolved the case successfully). Furthermore, initial “global” explanations about the process had no impact on immediate satisfaction but improved later judgments of understanding about the AI. Results of the second experiment show that visual and example-based explanations integrated with rationales had a significantly better impact on patient satisfaction and trust than no explanations, or with text-based rationales alone. As in Experiment 1, these explanations had their effect primarily on immediate measures of satisfaction during the re-diagnosis crisis, with little advantage prior to re-diagnosis or once the diagnosis was successfully resolved.
Conclusion:  These two studies help us to draw several conclusions about how patient-facing explanatory diagnostic systems may succeed or fail. Based on these studies and the review of the literature, we will provide some design recommendations for the explanations offered for AI systems in the healthcare domain.},

We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to i) identify high magnitude but low frequency non-linear mortality risk factors in the US population, ii) highlight distinct population sub-groups with shared risk characteristics, iii) identify non-linear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease, and iv) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model’s performance over time.

This overconfidence is worrying under distribution shifts, where the model performance silently degrades as the data distribution diverges from the training data distribution. Uncertainty estimation offers a solution to overconfident models, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Although methods for uncertainty estimation have been developed, they have not been explicitly linked to the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Furthermore, literature in operations research ignores the actionability component of uncertainty estimation and does not consider distribution shifts. This work proposes a general uncertainty framework, with contributions being threefold: (i) uncertainty estimation in ML models is positioned as an XAI technique, giving local and model-specific explanations; (ii) classification with rejection is used to reduce misclassifications by bringing a human expert in the loop for uncertain observations; (iii) the framework is applied to a case study on neural networks in educational data mining subject to distribution shifts. Uncertainty as XAI improves the model’s trustworthiness in downstream decision-making tasks, giving rise to more actionable and robust machine learning systems in operations research.},

In critical situations where it is essential to justify and explain the agent’s behaviour, better explainability and interpretability of RL models could help gain scientific insight on the inner workings of what is still considered a black box. We evaluate mainly studies directly linking explainability to RL, and split these into two categories according to the way the explanations are generated: transparent algorithms and post-hoc explainability.

	abstract = {Although deep reinforcement learning has become a promising machine learning approach for sequential decision-making problems, it is still not mature enough for high-stake domains such as autonomous driving or medical applications. In such contexts, a learned policy needs for instance to be interpretable, so that it can be inspected before any deployment (e.g., for safety and verifiability reasons). This survey provides an overview of various approaches to achieve higher interpretability in reinforcement learning (RL). To that aim, we distinguish interpretability (as an intrinsic property of a model) and explainability (as a post-hoc operation) and discuss them in the context of RL with an emphasis on the former notion. In particular, we argue that interpretable RL may embrace different facets: interpretable inputs, interpretable (transition/reward) models, and interpretable decisionmaking. Based on this scheme, we summarize and analyze recent work related to interpretable RL with an emphasis on papers published in the past 10 years. We also discuss briefly some related research areas and point to some potential promising research directions, notably related to the recent development of foundation models (e.g., large language models, RL from human feedback).},

However, provably optimal solutions may not be accepted due to the perception of optimization software as a black box. Although well understood by scientists, this lacks easy accessibility for practitioners. Hence, we advocate for introducing the explainability of a solution as another evaluation criterion, next to its objective value, which enables us to find tradeoff solutions between these two criteria. Explainability is attained by comparing against (not necessarily optimal) solutions that were implemented in similar situations in the past. Thus, solutions are preferred that exhibit similar features. Although we prove that already in simple cases the explainable model is NP-hard, we characterize relevant polynomially solvable cases such as the explainable shortest path problem. Our numerical experiments on both artificial as well as realworld road networks show the resulting Pareto front. It turns out that the cost of enforcing explainability can be very small.},

	abstract = {The extensive adoption of business analytics (BA) has brought ﬁnancial gains and increased efﬁciencies. However, these advances have simultaneously drawn attention to rising legal and ethical challenges when BA inform decisions with fairness implications. As a response to these concerns, the emerging study of algorithmic fairness deals with algorithmic outputs that may result in disparate outcomes or other forms of injustices for subgroups of the population, especially those who have been historically marginalized. Fairness is relevant on the basis of legal compliance, social responsibility, and utility; if not adequately and systematically addressed, unfair BA systems may lead to societal harms and may also threaten an organization’s own survival, its competitiveness, and overall performance. This paper offers a forward-looking, BA-focused review of algorithmic fairness. We ﬁrst review the state-of-the-art research on sources and measures of bias, as well as bias mitigation algorithms. We then provide a detailed discussion of the utility–fairness relationship, emphasizing that the frequent assumption of a trade-off between these two constructs is often mistaken or short-sighted. Finally, we chart a path forward by identifying opportunities for business scholars to address impactful, open challenges that are key to the effective and responsible deployment of BA.},

However, previous taxonomic approaches often remain at a purely descriptive level without leveraging morphological structures to investigate the mechanisms between different combinatorial options given in data analytics pipelines. To this end, we propose a taxonomic evaluation approach to evaluate and construct the technical core of analytical information systems more systematically. Specifically, we present a rough guidance model consisting of four steps, which we subsequently instantiate with two application scenarios from the fields of industrial maintenance and predictive business process monitoring. In this way, we demonstrate how taxonomic frameworks can guide the creation of structured evaluation studies to consider the construction and assessment of data analytics pipelines in a multi-perspective and holistic manner. Our approach is sufficiently generic to be applied to various domains, scenarios, and decision support tasks.},

	abstract = {Modern production systems face enormous challenges due to rising customer requirements resulting in complex production systems. The operational efﬁciency in the competitive industry is ensured by an adequate production control system that manages all operations in order to optimize key performance indicators. Currently, control systems are mostly based on static and model-based heuristics, requiring signiﬁcant human domain knowledge and, hence, do not match the dynamic environment of manufacturing companies. Data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) showed compelling results in applications such as board and computer games as well as ﬁrst production applications. This paper addresses the design of RL to create an adaptive production control system by the real-world example of order dispatching in a complex job shop. As RL algorithms are “black box” approaches, they inherently prohibit a comprehensive understanding. Furthermore, the experience with advanced RL algorithms is still limited to single successful applications, which limits the transferability of results. In this paper, we examine the performance of the state, action, and reward function RL design. When analyzing the results, we identify robust RL designs. This makes RL an advantageous control system for highly dynamic and complex production systems, mainly when domain knowledge is limited.},

The increasing individualisation of products requires adaptive production planning and control systems. Research in the area of Machine Learning demonstrates the applicability and potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems for the control of complex manufacturing. However, a major disadvantage of RL-methods is that they are usually considered as ‘black box’ models. For this reason, this paper investigates methods of explainable reinforcement learning in production control. Based on a comprehensive literature review an approach to increase the plausibility of RL-based control strategies is presented. The approach combines the advantages of high prediction accuracy (e.g. neural networks) and high explainability (e.g. decision trees). In doing so, understandable control strategies such as heuristics can be generated, and an advanced RL-system can be designed including specific domain expertise. The results are demonstrated based on a real-world system, taken from semiconductor manufacturing, which is investigated in a simulated approach.},

To achieve these goals, an intelligent, context-aware, adaptive energy management platform is required. This paper will demonstrate two district energy management optimisation strategies; one that optimises district heat generation from a multi-vector energy centre and a second that directly controls building demand via the heating set point temperature in addition to the heat generation. Several Artificial Neural Networks are used to predict variables such as building demand, solar photovoltaic generation, and indoor temperature. These predictions are utilised within a Genetic Algorithm to determine the optimal operating schedules of the heat generation equipment, thermal storage, and the heating set point temperature. Optimising the generation of heat for the district led to a 44.88\% increase in profit compared to a rule-based, priority order baseline strategy. An additional 8.04\% increase in profit was achieved when the optimisation could also directly control a proportion of building demand. These results demonstrates the potential gain when energy can be managed in a more holistic manner considering multiple energy vectors as well as both supply and demand.},

	abstract = {Both rising and more volatile energy prices are strong incentives for manufacturing companies to become more energy-efficient and flexible. A promising approach is the intelligent control of Industrial Energy Supply Systems (IESS), which provide various energy services to industrial production facilities and machines. Due to the high complexity of such systems widespread conventional control approaches often lead to suboptimal operating behavior and limited flexibility. Rising digitization in industrial production sites offers the opportunity to implement new advanced control algorithms e. g. based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize the operational strategies of IESS. This paper presents a comparative study of different controllers for optimized operation strategies. For this purpose, a framework is used that allows for a standardized comparison of rule-, model- and data-based controllers by connecting them to dynamic simulation models of IESS of varying complexity. The results indicate that controllers based on DRL and MILP have a huge potential to reduce energy-related cost of up to 50\% for less complex and around 6\% for more complex systems. In some cases however, both algorithms still show unfavorable operating behavior in terms of non-direct costs such as temperature and switching restrictions, depending on the complexity and general conditions of the systems.},

In this work, we propose an approach allowing to design and optimize the control of thermal systems in the buildings, while improving ﬂexibility and reusability. Consumer, producer, distributor and environmental agents are used to represent the building and its appliances. These agents’ internal models allow them to compute the energy needs, energy resources and associated costs, and take into account the speciﬁcities of the thermal systems. Following this modeling step, a distributed mechanism automatically controls the system, by combining a multi-criteria selection, a local optimization and a distributed allocation of the available resources. This approach was used to control a compact unit providing heating, ventilation and domestic hot water production in a low-energy building. The system was evaluated using a thermal simulator, and managed to improve the thermal comfort by 35 \% compared to the initial control system, for only a 2.5 \% increase in costs.},

In order to increase the knowledge about the current and future state in a district heating system at the producer side, each substation is equipped with an agent that makes predictions of future consumption and monitors current consumption. The contributions to the consumers, will be higher quality of service, e.g., better ways to deal with major shortages of heat water, which is facilitated by the introduction of redistribution agents, and lower costs since less energy is needed for the heat production. Current substations are purely reactive devices and have no communication capabilities. Thus, they are restricted to making local decisions without taking into account the global situation. However, a new type of "open" substation has been developed which makes the suggested agent-based approach possible.},

	abstract = {Bidirectional low temperature networks are a novel concept that promises more eﬃcient heating and cooling of buildings. Early research shows theoretical beneﬁts in terms of exergy eﬃciency over other technologies. Pilot projects indicate that the concept delivers good performance if heating and cooling demands are diverse. However, the operation of these networks is not yet optimized and there is no quantiﬁcation of the beneﬁts over other technologies in various scenarios. Moreover, there is a lack of understanding of how to integrate and control multiple distributed heat and cold sources in such networks. Therefore, this paper develops a control concept based on a temperature set point optimization and agent-based control which allows the modular integration of an arbitrary number of sources and consumers. Afterwards, the concept is applied to two scenarios representing neighborhoods in San Francisco and Cologne with diﬀerent heating and cooling demands and boundary conditions. The performance of the system is then compared to other state-of-the-art heating and cooling solutions using dynamic simulations with Modelica. The results show that bidirectional low temperature networks without optimization produce 26\% less emissions in the San Francisco scenario and 63\% in the Cologne scenario in comparison to the other heating and cooling solutions. Savings of energy costs are 46\% and 27\%, and reductions of primary energy consumption 52\% and 72\%, respectively. The presented operation optimization leads to electricity use reductions of 13\% and 41\% when compared to networks with free-ﬂoating temperature control and the results indicate further potential for improvement. The study demonstrates the advantage of low temperature networks in diﬀerent situations and introduces a control concept that is extendable for real implementation.},

	abstract = {Background: In Germany, the energy system is undergoing reorganisation from a centralised system based on fossil fuels and nuclear power to a sustainable system based on decentralised production and consumption of energy, the so-called Energiewende. Recently, there has been more attention to improving energy efficiency in those regions where conventional energy production activities and energy-intensive industries are located, such as the Ruhr area. Although the potential for decentralised combined heat and power (CHP) units is high in this region, local action plans show only modest developments for this technology. In this paper, we address this issue by answering the following research question: Which factors block the uptake and integration of decentralised CHP in the German Ruhr area's energy system?
Methods: The multilevel perspective (MLP) was used to analyse the state of system innovation in relation to the uptake and integration of decentralised CHP technology. Prior to the MLP analysis, a stakeholders' analysis was conducted to identify stakeholders' views, positions and experienced barriers regarding the uptake and integration of decentralised CHP technology. Data collection included review of text documents and conducting 11 interviews.
Results: Due to many regime barriers blocking niche development, the uptake of decentralised CHP technology is limited. Identified barriers relate to lack of market services and mismatches with user preferences, (sectoral) policies and industrial interests.
Conclusions: Observed barriers relate to (i) lack of market services such as financial means for making investments; (ii) user awareness such as unawareness and information deficit regarding the benefits of decentralised CHP to potential users, (iii) the presence of centralised district heating systems, (iv) policy issues such as lack of sufficient policies supporting diffusion of decentralised CHP units, legal stipulations from social housing policies that prevent housing cooperatives from becoming energy producers and district heating systems owned by public and private owners (via concessions contracts); (v) sector issues such as lack of skilled service-providing companies; and (vi) industrial interested such as the vested interests of the coal and gas industry. Moreover, many of the mentioned barriers seem interrelated, especially those concerning policy and finance available for making upfront investments.},

	abstract = {In order to realize an energy efficient and emission-free heat and cold supply in urban areas, 5th Generation District Heating and Cooling (5GDHC) networks are a promising technology. In 5GDHC networks, the control of the network temperature is crucial since it affects the efficiency of connected heat pumps and chillers, the heat losses (or gains) of the network, as well as the integration of waste heat or free cooling. Due to the large number of opposing effects, the optimal control of network temperatures is a challenging task. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is proposed for short-term optimization of the network temperature in 5GDHC systems. The model comprises an air-source heat pump, compression chiller and thermal storage in a central generation unit as well as heat pumps, chillers, electric boilers and thermal storages in buildings. Furthermore, the model considers the thermal inertia of the water mass in the network which functions as additional thermal storage. The optimization model is real-time capable and designed to be deployed in a model-predictive control. In a case study, the optimization approach leads to cost savings in two of three investigated months (by 10 \% and 60 \% respectively) compared to a reference operation strategy (free floating network temperature).},

This generation’s overarching goal is to develop heating concepts for smart energy systems contributing to the net-zero carbon emission society by substituting older district heating generations, originally developed for fossil fuels. The evolving technology generation has to consider the future challenges of lower heat demands, increased cooling demands, and integration of renewable and recycled thermal sources. Driven by these challenges, the district heating and cooling community is fast growing and very dynamic in its innovation. This trend can be observed in the development of cold networks for both heating and cooling. Several new systems in Europe, North America, and Asia have applied newly developed heating and cooling network conﬁgurations. It is essential to consolidate these novel technical solutions into the entire family of fourth generation at this stage of development to efﬁciently and effectively deploy and expand district heating and cooling solutions. This paper exemplary discusses ambiguous terms to demonstrate the shortfall of not having a broad and internationally accepted vocabulary. The conclusion gives suggestions for harmonising expressions, terms, and deﬁnitions introduced and used during the last years.

We demonstrate our model's capability on a real-world 5GDHC network with 6 km length and 180 distributed heat pumps. In contrast to existing models, we take into account the temperature dependency of the viscosity, which leads to a deviation of up to 65\% in pressure drop in the given example.

	abstract = {District heating and cooling (DHC) systems are considered cornerstones of a future heat and cold supply due to their ability to integrate renewable and waste heat sources as well as long and short-term storage technologies and their ﬂexibility for integration of other infrastructures. Therefore, DHC systems may represent the central hub of an interlinked overall energy system. These options nevertheless lead to a more complex system if implemented as the number of technical components and potential interactions increase and as the energy demands on the network grow. The transportation of the heat supplied to the consumers through water ﬂow involves both time and temperature-dependent changes based on the mass ﬂow rates and the heat losses to the surrounding from the pipes. The dynamic properties of the consumers and the distribution pipes strongly inﬂuence the operation of the district heating systems. Dynamic modeling tools are required to cope with the increasing complexities and to optimize the operation of the DHC systems by using the knowledge of time delay in the heat transport, temperature distribution and ﬂow characteristics. Nevertheless, it is computationally challenging to simulate largescale DHC networks dynamically. One proposed method for improvement in this context is aggregation, which simpliﬁes the topological complexities of the original network by reducing the number of pipe junctions (branches) and pipes. This paper focuses on the analysis and evaluation of the application of two aggregation methods, the Danish and the German method, in a dynamic modelling environment and comparing the aggregation to the monitoring data of a virtual district heating network with 146 consumers and an existing district heating network with 66 consumers. These evaluations are based on comparison of the simulation results of the aggregated network with fewer consumers than the original network in terms of accuracy, information loss and computational time. The results show that the CPU time in the simulation of this network can speed up approximately more than 95\% by aggregating the network down to 3 consumers without signiﬁcant information loss. We will highlight the current potentials and limitations of both aggregation methods in terms of integrating them in the planning, modelling and operation of DHC systems, including the 4th generation district heating systems.},

	abstract = {The adequate planning of district energy systems is a key process to provide communities with proper heating and cooling networks. To find cost-effective planning solutions, this decision-making process is usually formulated as mathematical model, which is optimized to determine where and how many assets should be installed in the network. However, this optimization problem is becoming more complex as district energy systems evolve and become more elaborate. For the 5th generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) networks, this planning framework comprises multiple building energy systems, a thermal and electrical network as well as central heating and cooling units. As a result, the optimization problem associated with these circumstances can easily become intractable as the number of elements of the network increases. To alleviate this tractability problem, in this paper, a Dantzig–Wolfe approach is devised to decompose a mixed-integer linear program into multiple subproblems (for every building) and a master problem (thermal and electrical network and central units). A realistic case study based on a 5GDHC system in Germany is considered. For this case study, it is demonstrated that the proposed decomposition approach yields the same results attained by the original not decomposed problem while achieving significant gains in terms of scalability and computational times. More specifically, the decomposition approach reduces the computational time for districts with more than 10 buildings by in average 94\%. This corroborates the potential of the proposed approach to improve the computational efficiency of models that will deliver cost-effective investment plans for 5GDHC networks.},

	abstract = {Integrated smartly controlled energy networks have the potential to deliver signiﬁcant reductions in carbon emissions, improve air quality and reduce energy costs for end-users across the world. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the development of integrated thermal, power and mobility 5th generation (5G) smart energy networks. The proposed 5G concept builds on state of the art by connecting ﬂexible electricity demands such as heat pumps, and electric vehicles to intermittent, renewable and secondary energy sources and storage using artiﬁcial intelligence to facilitate optimal control and to maximise revenue and carbon savings. The proposed innovative method is being applied in central London through the development of two independent 5G smart energy schemes. The proposed schemes will incorporate a range of different renewables and secondary energy sources, for example, waste heat from local data centres and the London Underground that will supply a large proportion of the energy demand of the overall district network capacity. Both networks will operate at close to ambient temperature, approximately 15e25  C as a so-called ‘ambient loop’ system, with individual heat pumps for each end-user or building connected to the network. The system also integrates thermal and electrical storage to create additional ﬂexibility for the network and smart control for demand-side management. A smart management system ﬂexibly controls individual assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles in response to price signals reﬂecting the intermittency of renewable energy sources on the electricity grid. The ambient district thermal loop will distribute low carbon energy to a range of end users. Results presented in this paper provide an understanding of capital costs associated with integrated smart energy systems and the relative performance of individual technologies in a complex system using a techno-economic modelling approach. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the implementation of the 5G concept results in lower energy costs to consumers while at the same time transforming a large existing urban area to a near zero-carbon energy system in terms of heating, cooling, electricity and transport.},

Therefore, the power systems need alternative forms of flexibility potentials to hedge against the intermittent power. District Heating Systems (DHS), especially Heat Pump Systems (HPS), show true potentials to provide demand-side flexibility for power systems. This paper aims to survey the literature on the applications of DHS in power system flexibility. In this way, first of all, the basic structure of the DHS, including the heat resources, thermal units, and thermal storage, is surveyed to give insight into the DHS problem. Afterward, classifying flexibility potentials of the DHS, the conventional and advanced control strategies of the DHS are reviewed comprehensively to investigate the role of heat controllers on power system flexibility. To study the compatibility of the controllers to flexible energy markets, the roles of different control schemes in successive trading floors of the electricity markets, from the energy market to ancillary service markets, are investigated. Finally, the optimization solutions, including mathematical and heuristic approaches, with software tools are reviewed to give readers general insight into the way a DHS problem is modeled and solved.},

	abstract = {District heating networks increasingly rely on heat pumps, condensing biomass boilers, and excess heat in the transition to sustainable energy systems. Accordingly, district heating operators seek to reduce their networks’ supply and return temperatures to maximise production efﬁciencies, minimise heat losses from distribution pipes and allow greater utilisation of renewable heat sources and excess heat. Experts have predicted that investing in solutions that reduce heating temperatures in buildings will yield a return on investment of 300\% for district heating operators. Therefore, expecting incentives, building operators should identify methods to reduce supply and return temperatures to enable a rapid, widespread transition to low-temperature district heating. Ample research has investigated and documented the feasibility of low-temperature heating in buildings, and this paper presents the ﬁrst comprehensive review. It synthesises available literature and adds new perspectives to help guide future implementation, research and development of low-temperature heating. The energy and temperature demands of various heating systems provides a background, leading to a review of typical malfunctions and their impacts. The article subsequently reviews the obtainable supply and return temperatures before and after renovating the building envelope and heating systems. It further identiﬁes and summarises vital measures for decreasing heating system temperatures. Ultimately, the authors recommend minimising heating system temperatures using automatic balancing of space heating and ventilation systems, novel solutions for safe domestic hot water supply, and digitally-enabled performance monitoring and optimal control.},

	abstract = {Flexibility in district heating and cooling systems (thermal networks in general) is an important means to cope with the intermittent generation of heat and electricity as the share of renewable energy sources (RES) increases. An important source of ﬂexibility is the thermal energy storage present in district heating and cooling networks, found in the thermal inertia of buildings, storage units and the network itself. To unlock this ﬂexibility and to use it effectively and efﬁciently, a suitable control strategy is required. In this context, this paper presents a possible deﬁnition of ﬂexibility and its sources in a thermal network. It reviews techniques to quantify ﬂexibility and shows the need for a more advanced control strategy; moreover, it discusses the challenges involved in developing such a control strategy. Also, the literature on advanced control in thermal networks is reviewed, by making a distinction between central, distributed and hybrid control. Finally, possible future research topics are identiﬁed based on the ﬁndings.},

	abstract = {As large energy prosumers in district energy systems, on the one hand, data centers consume a large amount of electricity to ensure the Information Technologies (IT) facilities, ancillary power supply and cooling systems work properly; on the other hand, data centers produce a large quantity of waste heat due to the high heat dissipation rates of the IT facilities. To date, a systematic review of data centers from the perspective of energy prosumers, which considers both integration of the upstream green energy supply and downstream waste heat reuse, is still lacking. As a result, the potentials for improving data centers’ performances are limited due to a lack of global optimization of the upstream renewable energy integration and downstream waste heat utilization. This study is intended to fill in this gap and provides such a review. In this regard, the advancements in different cooling techniques, integration of renewable energy and advanced controls, waste heat utilization and connections for district heating, real projects, performance metrics and economic, energy and environmental analyses are reviewed. Based on the enormous amount of research on data centers in district energy systems, it has been found that: (1) global controls, which can manage the upstream renewable production, data centers’ operation and waste heat generation and downstream waste heat utilization are still lacking; (2) regional climate studies represent an effective way to find the optimal integration of renewable energy and waste heat recovery technologies for improving the data centers’ energy efficiency; (3) the development of global energy metrics will help to appropriately quantify the data center performances.},

Various attempts can be found in the literature concerning thermal demand modiﬁcation in district heating, despite often researchers working on this topic are not fully aware of the other research activities also because various names are used to identify similar techniques. This paper represents the ﬁrst survey on the use demand side application in district heating networks. The review clariﬁes the terminology and the stages for implementing demand side management to district heating network. Simulations and real applications are both considered in the review, including direct and indirect demand side management (demand response). Demand side management is found to be a great technique for district heating management. Various works show that the following beneﬁts can be achieved: peak shaving up to 30\%, doubled load factor, reduction of primary energy needs up to 5\%, emission and cost reduction up to 10\%. This clearly leads to signiﬁcant cost and emission reduction, contributing to the decarbonization of urban areas.},

	abstract = {The article addresses matters concerned with digitalization and intellectualization of district heating systems (DHS) and is of a reviewing and problem-stating nature. Intellectualization of DHSs is viewed as a process of transition for a fundamentally new platform, within which it becomes possible to efficiently coordinate the interests, requirements, and capacities of all stakeholders participating in the heat-supply processes, and the consumer is given the role of an active full-fledged participant. The main lines, aims, and features of this process are briefly characterized. Both domestic and foreign experience gained from setting up centralized (district) heat-supply systems, including the most advanced development trends of these systems in EU member states. Special attention is paid to matters concerned with intellectualization of Russian DHSs. It is shown that the transition for a new paradigm will generate the need to cardinally revise the existing practices of DHS design, operation, and supervisory (dispatch) control. The key lines and tasks connected with transition to the new concept of managing the operation of DHSs as cyberphysical objects are formulated. The transition to this concept implies a wide use of mathematical and computer modeling methods for automating the DHS state monitoring processes, its analysis, prediction, and optimization. A significant part of the article is devoted to an analytical review of the current state of scientific-methodical developments in this field in four basic lines: mathematical modeling of DHS operation modes (hydraulic, temperature and thermal-hydraulic, stationary and dynamic, deterministic and probabilistic), identification of the DHS’s actual state (equipment characteristics, operating parameters, etc.) based on measurement data, optimization of DHS operation modes (for estimating the effectiveness of new heat-supply technologies, efficient DHS operation, and optimal control of DHS operation modes), and software for computer modeling of DHSs. Informative statements of DHS mathematical and computer modeling tasks are described along with the background developments for solving them available at ESI SB (Russian Academy of Sciences) are described.},

	abstract = {The building sector is a significant contributor to global energy consumption and accounts for approximately one-third of total greenhouse gas emissions. While building energy analysis has traditionally focused on individual buildings, analyzing larger settlements, such as districts or neighbors, offers additional opportunities. The objective of this study is to define and classify typical urban areas for energy analysis, referred to in this paper as Urban Energy Units (UEUs), which represent geographical regions within a city with specific building’s characteristics, settlement patterns and energy demand. Sixteen different UEUs were classified using literature and open data. The proposed methodology leverages open-source data and uses a random forest model to enhance missing building properties of the building stock such as building age and construction type. It further subdivides the study area into geographically defined sections, and deploys a decision tree model to classify these sections into the sixteen different UEUs. These UEUs enable the creation of energy districts in a modular manner and flexible for its use in any given area. This study demonstrates the practical implications related to the 2023 german municipality heating plan. The methodology was applied in Oldenburg, a mid-sized German city. The city was subdivided into a total of 8249 UEUs, with the detailed results for energy demand presented in this report.},

Lately, prosumers have also been discussed as a part of the district heating systems. This calls for more knowledge in this area. The present study seeks to evaluate the potential for district heating contribution from small scale prosumers, based on excess heat, and their environmental impact in an area with diverse building types. The results were mainly developed through a case study performed on Hyllie, an area under construction in Malmö, Sweden. Data from property developers and some measured data were used to evaluate the annual prosumer potential of buildings. Environmental calculations were performed by simulations in the commercial simulation programme NetSim and data from Swedish literature. Four cases were investigated, based on whether the prosumers were allowed to deliver heat beyond the Hyllie borders or not and on two different ways of managing the supply temperature. The temperature of the excess heat was either raised with a heat pump, or directly utilised in the district heating network. In the latter case, the temperature of the domestic hot water was raised with electricity. The results showed that the potential for excess heat prosumers is fairly big, in Hyllie around 50–120\% of the annual heat demand. Most of the excess heat is however produced during the summer months. The environmental results showed that the environmental output of the electricity applied in the prosumer solution decided whether or not the prosumer solution was better than the conventional district heating solution.},

	abstract = {Fifth generation district heating and cooling networks are characterized by supply temperatures in the ambient range of 15–25 °C, which not only reduces heat loss but also allows for integrating various kinds of low-temperature waste heat sources. The ability of these networks to absorb waste heat that is normally unrecoverable makes them an attractive solution for the future energy supply of urban areas. To enhance the adoption of these networks, this paper describes the development of a software tool to analyze the feasibility of ﬁfth-generation of district heating and cooling systems in both new and existing districts. The research attempts to answer the question: ”Which buildings should be connected to a low-temperature hydraulic network given both the incremental beneﬁts and costs relative to the scenario of decentralized (dedicated) heating and cooling systems for each building?” Therefore, all possible network layouts of the buildings are considered where the heating and cooling demands of each building are met by the ﬁfth-generation of district heating and cooling network. For the heating and cooling load characterization of the buildings, reduced-order models are used while renewable energy and waste heat sources are included in the network. The focus of the research lies in the development of a hydraulic model for ﬂexible use in the urban energy modeling and the optimization of the ﬁfth-generation of district heating and cooling network topology for a given urban district. Simulation results quantify the performance of the ﬁfth-generation of district heating and cooling network based on various output metrics, including primary energy usage, carbon dioxide emissions, and network implementation cost.},

District heating and cooling systems are a viable solution to provide heat and cold in urban environments. Renewable heat and cold sources that may get incorporated in future urban energy systems will not provide the same high temperature output as current fossil fuel ﬁred systems. Fifth generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) systems are decentralized, bidirectional, close to ground temperature networks that use direct exchange of warm and cold return ﬂows and thermal storage to balance thermal demand as much as possible. 5GDHC offers a way to incorporate low temperature renewable heat sources including shallow geothermal energy, as well as reduce total demand by recuperating generated heat from cooling and generated cold from heating. The large scale of 5GDHC allows for optimal design of technical parts like heat pumps and thermal storage vessels, while increasing overall system efﬁciency by incorporating a large variety of supply and demand proﬁles. We provide a deﬁnition for 5GDHC and show how this concept differs from conventional district heating systems.

Research has shown that optimising buildings' heating demands can release network congestion and contribute to reducing primary energy usages. Coupled with end-user privacy concerns, an approach in which buildings jointly optimise their heating demands while preserving privacy needs to be investigated. In view of this need, we have developed a distributed demand response approach based on exchange ADMM to support distributed agent-based heating demand optimisation for the district heating system with minimal private information exchanges. This paper summarises mathematical derivation, simulation and implementation of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach obtained the same results as its centralised counterpart proposed in the existing literature and the sensible information exchanges were substantially reduced. An implementation at multiple spatial scales and time scales on micro-controllers and a communication system validates the proposed approach in a practical context. In conclusion, the proposed approach is suitable for real-world implementation in a large-scale district heating system.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-scale framework for the design and comparison of centralised and distributed heat generation solutions. An extensive analysis of commercially available products on the UK market is conducted to gather information on the performance and cost of a range of gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) systems, air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) and ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs). Data-driven models with associated uncertainty bounds are derived from the collected data, which capture cost and performance variations with scale (i.e., size and rating) and operating conditions. In addition, a comprehensive thermoeconomic (thermodynamic and component-costing) heat pump model, validated against manufacturer data, is developed to capture design-related performance and cost variations, thus reducing technology-related model uncertainties. The novelty of this paper lies in the use of multi-fidelity approaches for the comparison of the economic and environmental potential of important heat-generation solutions: (i) centralised gas-fired CHP systems associated with district heating network; (ii) gas-fired CHP systems or GSHPs providing heat to differentiated energy communities; and (iii) small-scale micro-CHP systems, ASHPs or GSHPs, installed at the household level. The pathways are evaluated for the case of the Isle of Dogs district in London, UK. A centralised CHP system appears as the most profitable option, achieving annual savings of £13 M compared to the use of decentralised boilers and a levelised cost of heat equal to 31 £/MWhth. However, if the carbon intensity of the electrical grid continues to reduce at current rates, CHP systems will only provide minimal carbon savings compared to boilers ({\textless} 6\%), with heat pumps achieving significant heat decarbonisation (55–62\%). Differentiating between high- and lowperformance and cost heat pump designs shows that the former, although 25\% more expensive, have significantly lower annualised costs (£4.9 M vs. £7.7 M) and 12\% higher CO2-equivalent savings. The uncertainty propagation reveals that data-driven and detailed thermoeconomic models can reduce the uncertainty in the total annualised energy cost and emissions by more than 75\% compared to simplified black-box approaches, while the economic comparison of centralised CHP systems and domestic heat pumps for various electricity and gas price scenarios provides guidance to support energy policy.},

Therefore, the performance of three different heating system scenarios for a new housing district is investigated. Low (60  C) and ultra-low (20  C) network temperatures are investigated. The case study includes about 100 different single-family and multi-family houses. Two scenarios contain networks with temperatures of 20 and 60  C. The third scenario is extended with solar collectors and a supermarket as decentralised prosumers who supply heat to the network in times of surplus. The network can simulate bidirectional ﬂows. Based on the principles of graph theory, a combined hydraulic and thermal model is developed and used for this study. The results show a heat loss reduction in ultra-low temperature networks due to lower network working temperatures (20  C) of about 80\% compared to a low-temperature network. The implementation of prosumers considerably reduces the demand from a central heat source. In this study, 20\% of the total heating demand can be covered by excess heat of the prosumer supply.},

	abstract = {District Heating (DH) technology is considered to be a sustainable and quasi-renewable way of producing and distributing hot water along the city to heat buildings. However, the main obstacle to wider adoption of DH technology is represented by the thermal request peak in the morning hours of winter days, especially in Mediterranean countries. In this paper, this peak-shaving problem is tackled by combining three different approaches. A thermodynamic model is used to monitor the buildings’ thermal response to energy profile modifications. An agent-based model is adopted in order to represent the end-users and their adaptability to variations of temperatures in buildings. Finally, a Reinforcement Learning algorithm is used to optimally mediate between two needs: on the one hand, a set of anticipations and delays is applied to the energy profiles in order to reduce the thermal request peak. On the other hand, the algorithm learns by trial and error the individual agents’ sensitivity to thermal comfort, avoiding drastic modifications for the most sensitive users. The experiments carried out in the DH network in Torino (north-west of Italy) demonstrate that the proposed approach, compared with a literature solution chosen as a baseline, allows to achieve better results in terms of overall performances and speed of convergence.},

	abstract = {The development over the last decade of the district heating (DH) network of Gleisdorf (Austria) represents an innovative example for a transition to a 4th generation DH network (4GDH). The local DH operator has strong ambitions towards implementing a highly efficient, nearly 100\% renewable DH system using local resources. These goals will be achieved by the development and implementation of a novel control strategy, namely a “Virtual Heating Plant” (VHP) control concept. The VHP concept is an intelligent high level control system using operating data for real time calculations and a 24h prediction to optimise the overall DH network. The VHP control is fully implemented into the DH system and led to an improved and more flexible unit commitment, higher solar yields and more stable operating conditions. This paves the way to integrate multiple decentralised local heat sources and existing boiler units as well as other systemic approaches (e.g. sector coupling with waste water treatment plant, cascading heat supply out of the return pipe, stepwise system temperature reduction, implementation of an intelligent, decentral storage concept) and non-technical measures (e.g. user and stakeholder integration).},

District Heating (DH) is one of the key enabler for energy transition in cities and, in literature, several tools address its analysis and modelling. Usually the focus in analysing energy systems in cities is oriented on the specific fields and thus models and simulation tools are too sectorized and unable to interact in a larger perspective. Therefore, co-simulation paradigm is exponentially gaining attention as well as Multi Agent Systems (MAS). The lack of multidisciplinary approaches holds especially when dealing with DH and the interconnected subsystems that belongs to different domains. Therefore our proposition consists on a MAS-based co-simulation framework to simulate DH system behaviour while easily integrating models of other subsystems (e.g. buildings and storage). We have tested this distributed and modular framework with two case studies to asses a peak reduction strategy exploiting thermal storage. In conclusion, we have showed the flexibility of our tool while analysing benefits of a simple peak reduction strategy.},

	abstract = {The latest generation of district heating networks, the so-called cold district heating networks, are characterised by a system temperature between 5°C and 35°C. This allows for the efficient integration of renewable heat sources with low supply temperatures. Furthermore, cold district heating networks enable the district’s cooling demand to be met centrally. These advantages can play an important role in the future design of sustainable decentralized energy systems, as the heating sector is still predomiantly fueld by fossile resources and cooling demands rise. In this context, this paper highlights the modelling of cold district heating networks in an existing multi-criteria optimization model for decentral multi-energy systems. This enables the possibility to investigate the techno-economic and -ecologic efficiency of cold district heating networks and their competition and synergies with other design options especially in the interlinked heat, cooling and electricity sectors. Exemplary results of the applied model exhibit the required and achieved detail in the modeling. For the analysed district, we identify an optimal grid temperature of 18°C. The main parameters influencing this ideal grid temperature are the grid heat pumps efficiency and the heat losses within the grid.},

	abstract = {District heating systems become more distributed with the integration of prosumers, including excess heat producers and active consumers. This calls for suitable heat market mechanisms that optimally integrate these actors, while minimizing and allocating operational costs. We argue for the inclusion of network constraints to ensure network feasibility and incentivize loss reductions. We propose a network-aware heat market as a Quadratic Program (QP), which determines the optimal dispatch and a set of nodal marginal prices. While heat network dynamics are generally represented by non-convex constraints, we convexify this formulation by fixing temperature variables and neglecting pumping power. The resulting variable flow heating network model leaves the sign and size of the nodal heat injections flexible, which is important for the integration of prosumers. The market is based on peer-to-peer trades to which we add explicit loss terms. This allows us to trace network losses back to the producer and consumer of these losses. Through a dual analysis we reveal loss components of nodal prices, as well as relations between nodal prices and between seller and buyer prices. A case study illustrates the advantages of the network-aware market by comparison to our proposed loss-agnostic benchmark. We show that the network-aware market mechanism effectively promotes local heat consumption and thereby reduces losses and total cost. We conclude that the proposed loss-aware market mechanism can help reduce operating costs in district heating networks while integrating prosumers.},

	abstract = {District heating is an efficient and promising way to cover the residential space-heating and domestic hot water needs, resulting in economic and environmental benefits, especially if operated by renewable power stations, when compared to fossil fuels. In this direction, the present study investigates in detail a district heating network with novel decentralized storage for domestic hot water (enerboxx scenario), over centralized storage systems, applying a specific schedule-based approach for the coordinated hot water tank charging. The goal of this design is to properly control the system by charging it at predetermined time periods during the day aiming at i) diminishing the thermal losses and ii) reducing the thermal demand from the grid, over the period of a day. The simulation is conducted with a newly developed component-based tool, called INTEMA, which is based on the Modelica language. This encompasses the ability to discretize with high temporal resolution and adjustable time steps the overall grid configuration, with the support of customizable level of detail models for simulating key system components such as the storage tanks, the piping and the dwelling needs, as well as the application of an advanced control system over the district heating network and the dwellings. More specifically, a combined control system that controls both operating parameters in the network and inside the dwellings is applied. The developed system model is verified against available data for a standard centralized storage system (reference scenario) and afterwards, the novel decentralized design is compared against corresponding results of the standard system, as concerns key operational parameters; indicatively the temperature levels of the hot water and the heat load demand. The analysis is conducted for a heating network of 9 dwellings in Austria, which have an underfloor heating system, a system for covering the domestic hot water demand, considering also that each of these 9 dwellings is characterized by a unique demand profile. It was found that the decentralized approach leads to lower demand and there are energy savings of 18 \% compared to the reference scenario, while the thermal losses are reduced by about 22 \%. Moreover, a parametric study regarding the storage tank volume and the heat exchanger thermal transmittance in the tank is conducted, in order to examine the impact of these design parameters on the system dynamic behavior.},

The model comprehensively characterizes the heat transport in the system and a dispatch problem considering hybrid regulation of ﬂuid ﬂow rates and temperatures in DHN is then established.

	abstract = {Decarbonisation of the thermal grid whilst ensuring affordability and security of supply, requires a holistic approach which relies on sector coupling and energy storage. District heating and cooling networks with decentralised energy substations featuring heat pumps and thermal energy storage could provide such holistic heat decarbonisation. However, the extent of sector synergies, technoeconomic and market uptake hurdles are still unclear. This paper evaluates the opportunities and barriers related to technoeconomic performance, sector coupling facilitation and market uptake of district heating and cooling networks with decentralised energy substations. It follows a systematic literature review process and integrates its findings with insights from in­ terviews held with 18 stakeholders from leading academic and industrial institutions. Findings suggest that high seasonal demand co-occurrence is crucial to minimize operational costs. Networks with a low number of pro­ sumers can avoid hydraulic instabilities and control complexities and offer grid stability through voltage and frequency regulation when correctly coordinated. Novel mechanisms on business models, asset ownership and tariff structure are vital for a widespread market uptake. Overall, the system needs to be viewed as a tool in the arsenal of decarbonisation solutions with further research required on beneficial operation boundaries, hydraulic operation standardisation and business structure redefinition.},

	abstract = {District cooling system (DCS) enjoys improved cooling efficiency due to economies of scale cooling. However, most DCSs import electricity from the power grid, intensifying the electricity peak and grid investments. In addition, improving environmental sustainability is one of the major targets of DCSs. This study proposes a novel grid-free configuration to decouple the DCS from the power grid and natural gas networks. Meanwhile, an alternative operating strategy, waste cold energy recovery, ice storage, and cooling demand response are employed to promote the environmental sustainability of the DCS. Key results from this study have revealed that the proposed DCS does not need to import electricity from the power grid and facilitates a flexible plant location without the limitation of the natural gas network. Under the basic configuration, the daily primary energy saving rate (PESR) and energy cost saving rate (ECSR) can achieve 22.4\% and 62.8\%, respectively. The alternative operating strategy enhances the system’s part-load performance while the cold energy recovery unit facilitates extra cooling production. Further, the incorporation of the ice storage module improves the system’s average load rate and reduces the chillers’ capacity. Finally, the blockchain-based decentralized network provides a trusted platform for implementing cooling demand response. Cooling demand response mitigates the cooling peak and total cooling consumption by precooling the space and adjusting the indoor set-point temperature in terms of the overall cooling load rate. Adopting these sustainable technologies yields the daily PESR and ECSR up to 35.2\% and 68.9\%, respectively.},

This paper addresses these issues, presenting a holistic approach to compare and optimize district heating supply and decentralized heat supply, which is applicable to arbitrary districts. For this purpose, load profiles for space heating, domestic hot water and electricity are generated utilizing an archetype approach and statistical data. To identify the most economic supply variant, optimization models are created, using the Open Energy Modelling Framework. The optimization results are compared and the most economic supply variant is identified. The method is demonstrated with a case study of a district with a heat density of 491.15 kW h∕(m2 a), considering different emission reduction targets and energy costs. The results show that, for a district with these properties, district heating has lower levelized costs of heating than decentralized heat supply for 94\% of the investigated variants. The difference lies between 0.002 e∕kWh and 0.135 e∕kWh, depending on energy prices and emission reduction target. In the future, the developed method will be used to investigate the influence of various district characteristics on the economic efficiency of supply variants.},

	abstract = {District heating is an efficient method of distributing heat in densely populated areas at a low cost. The heat is usually produced at central production plants and then distributed to consumers through large networks of pipes. However, district heating is gradually becoming more decentralised with additional heat sources, e.g. heat pumps, solar thermal farms, and industrial waste heat connected to the network. Therefore, the system is changing from a system with centralised heat sources to a more decentralised system with several different heat sources within the network, including also still a large production area. Operationally this is more complex than the previous setup, especially in terms of temperature optimisation. Typically, the temperature must be adjusted for each area in order to work efficiently with the decentralised heat sources, so a forecast of the local heat load is required. It is relatively easy to make a forecast for each area, but they are usually made independently and are therefore not necessarily coherent. In this paper, we propose a methodology to spatially reconcile hierarchies of individual localised heat load forecasts with a coherency constraint. This results in coherent reconciled forecasts. Enhancing forecast accuracy and making them coherent are essential for future decentralised systems as temperature and production optimisation need accurate information to yield optimal operation. We will use two different case studies to illustrate the proposed method. One case study has a few areas, while the other case study will have more areas, and here it is proposed to add a new level of aggregation to the hierarchy to increase accuracy. The results in this paper show that the reconciled forecast, where information is shared between areas through the spatial hierarchy, improves forecast accuracy by 1\% to 20\%, depending on the prediction horizon.},

	abstract = {In future smart thermal grids, decentralized prosumers shall supply each other over the network, optimized by an overarching management system. For this, the substation control must be able to directly process optimal power flow setpoints from the management, while considering the mutual influence of prosumers on the technical level. Addressing these requirements, this paper develops a control approach for bidirectional prosumer substations. Therefore, we identify the objectives and characteristics of the control problem, before relaxing it by reformulation. This enables to keep proportional–integral–derivative controllers (PIDs) for operating the pumps and valves as decentral actuators in the substations. We propose a control approach, exploring the combination of two key aspects: (1) The assignment of temperature objectives to actuators. (2) Weighted error functions that linearly combine temperature and power errors as input for the PIDs, allowing to handle multiple objectives with limited actuators. Through case studies, we validate the suitability of our proposed objective–actuator assignment and demonstrate the necessity and benefits of the weighted error functions. Like this, we conclude with a control approach for bidirectional prosumer substations that aims for the relevant temperature objectives, directly considers heat transfer setpoints, replicates and exploits the coupling within the network, effectively manages conflicting objectives, copes with prosumer interference, and is pragmatic for real-time operation. Our approach can be transferred to different network concepts, bridging the gap between decentralized field-level operation and the management level.},

	abstract = {This article investigates 40 thermal networks in operation in Europe that are able to cover both the heating and cooling demands of buildings by means of distributed heat pumps installed at the customer substations. The technology of thermal networks that work at a temperature close to the ground, can strongly contribute to the decarbonisation of the heating and cooling sector and furthermore exploit a multitude of low temperature heat sources. Nevertheless, the nomenclature used in literature shows that misinterpretations could easily result when comparing the different concepts of thermal networks that operate at a temperature level lower than traditional district heating. The scope of this work is to revise the definitions encountered and to introduce an unambiguous definition of Fifth-Generation District Heating and Cooling networks. A drawback-benefit analysis is presented to identify the pros and cons of such technology. The survey on the current networks shows that on average three Fifth-Generation District Heating and Cooling systems per year have entered the heating and cooling market in the last decade. Pioneer countries in such technology are Germany and Switzerland. For some networks, the assessed Linear Heating Power Demand Density results are lower than the feasibility threshold adopted in traditional district heating. High performances and low non-renewable primary energy factors are achieved in systems that exploit a very high share of renewable or urban excess heat sources. With respect to traditional district heating, the surveyed pumping energy consumptions result one order of magnitude higher, whereas the implemented control strategies can be completely different, leading the network temperature to float freely.},

The ﬁfth-generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) concept, often referred to as ambient loops, is a novel solution emerging in Europe and has become a widely discussed topic in current energy system research. 5GDHC systems operate at a temperature close to the ground and include electrically driven heat pumps and associated thermal energy storage in a building-sited energy transfer station (ETS) to satisfy user comfort. This work presents new strategies for improving the operation of these energy transfer stations by means of a model predictive control (MPC) method based on recurrent artiﬁcial neural networks. The results show that, under simple time-of-use utility rates, the advanced controller outperforms a rule-based controller for smart charging of the domestic hot water (DHW) thermal energy storage under speciﬁc boundary conditions. By exploiting the available thermal energy storage capacity, the MPC controller is capable of shifting up to 14\% of the electricity consumption of the ETS from on-peak to oﬀ-peak hours. Therefore, the advanced control implemented in 5GDHC networks promotes coupling between the thermal and the electric sector, producing ﬂexibility on the electric grid.},

The analysis shows that these two are common not only in the overarching aim of decarbonization but that they also to some extent share the ﬁve essential abilities ﬁrst deﬁned for 4GDH. The main driver for 5GDHC has been a strong focus on combined heating and cooling, using a collective network close to ambient temperature levels as common heat source or sink for building-level heat pumps. It is found that 5GDHC can be regarded as a promising technology with its own merits, yet a complementary technology that may coexist in parallel with other 4GDH technologies. However, the term “generation” implies a chronological succession, and the label 5GDHC does not seem compatible with the established labels 1GDH to 4GDH.},

	abstract = {Energy geostructures are novel dual use engineering sub-structures that can be used for heat transfer and storage as well as original structural function. Their use is becoming increasingly popular in delivering cost-effective shallow geothermal energy. Currently, they are mostly used as a part of groundsource heat pump (GSHP) systems for supplying partial or full heating and cooling demands of different types of buildings. The recent introduction of ﬁfth generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) networks can pave the way for the exploitation of energy geostructures as ground-coupled lowtemperature energy sources and stores for providing energy demands of a wider range of energy users in districts rather than single buildings. In this article, the capability and feasibility of the novel concept of integration of energy geostructures into the 5GDHC networks are evaluated through reviewing different aspects of thermal performance of operating energy geostructures and 5GDHC networks. The potential advantages and challenges along with the knowledge gaps in such integration are discussed, and some practical recommendations are provided concerning dealing with some implementation challenges. It is highlighted that the incorporation of energy geostructures in 5GDHC networks can enhance the sustainability, ﬂexibility and resilience of the network. There is the potential to exploit a greater share of cost-effective geothermal energy, and the ability to act as both thermal energy sources and stores for efﬁciently supplying both heating and cooling demands. However, since the development of ﬁfth generation thermal networks and energy geostructures, particularly energy walls and energy tunnels, are still in their infancy, further research is required to assess the magnitude of the opportunities and quantify the advantages of integrating energy geostructures into the 5GDHC networks.},

	abstract = {The decarbonisation of heat requires a transition from gas boilers to low-carbon heating systems such as heat pumps. Efﬁciency gains can be achieved by linking heating systems through ambient loops called Fifth Generation District Heating and Cooling (5GDHC) networks. The UK needs working demonstrators to understand both the technical and practical challenges in the heat transition. The Balanced Energy Network (BEN) links two buildings on LSBU's campus and is the UK's ﬁrst 5GDHC system at scale and among the ﬁrst in the world to be retroﬁt in parallel to an incumbent gas system and include an active demand side response control system to toggle between energy vectors in way that minimises cost and carbon emissions. This paper presents performance data from its ﬁrst year of operation in baseline mode, as it was commissioned and optimised. High temperature heat pumps were retroﬁt to an existing gas boiler circuit and match the 79  C output temperature of the gas boiler system. No fabric upgrades were required and no pipes, ducts or heat emitters were resized, however the system maintained performance to reduce overall building carbon emissions by 13\% and gas use by 40\% across both buildings compared to the pervious heating season while the system was in use.},

	abstract = {As global urbanisation levels continue to rise, supplying urban areas with low emissions energy becomes imperative in the fight against climate change. In areas with high demand density, district heating and cooling systems are generally a more efficient alternative compared to individual solutions, but current systems are mainly powered by fossil fuels and suffer from significant thermal losses due to high operating temperatures. Fifth-generation district heating and cooling systems (5GDHC) is a promising technology, able to address these drawbacks. 5GDHC systems operate at near ambient temperature, ensuring efficient integration of renewable energy sources and waste heat recovery potential. Their ability to provide simultaneous heating and cooling through the same pipeline and bidirectional energy flows allow for load balancing through the harvesting of demand synergies between different users. 5GDHC systems can play an important role in the energy transition but not much is known about their environmental performance over their life cycle and the novelty of the concept means that planning and design guidelines are scarcely present in the literature, hindering their development and further adoption. This study critically reviews recent advancements in the relevant literature as the 5GDHC technology transitions from research and development to the demonstration phase. Moreover, the paper addresses the design parameters and methodologies encountered in the literature for the modelling and operation of 5GDHC systems. Finally, the economic and environmental performance are discussed while pre­ senting an overview of future developments and challenges related to full-scale deployment.},

Up to today, only a small number of 5GDHC networks have been built, mostly in Switzerland and Germany. As a result, there are substantial uncertainties and knowledge gaps in the planning and operation of 5GDHC networks. Herein, a survey is conducted among utility companies and engineering offices to collect data on 53 5GDHC systems in Germany, including technical, economic, and political key figures and design decisions. Results show that 5GDHC networks are mostly planned for small new build districts (less than 100 buildings). The most frequent heat sources are horizontal geothermal collectors (used in 23 networks) and geothermal probes (17 networks). 74\% of the surveyed networks provide not only heat but also cold. Typical network temperatures are in the range of −5–20 °C. The survey results show that the price models as well as political design decisions, such as the obligation to connect to the network, vary strongly among the districts.},

Challenges and benefits of these transitions are mostly analyzed from a perspective of current energy demand and supply scenarios while the influence from future changes in these domains remains unknown. Based on a representative residential community in the Nordic district heating context, centralized district heating and cooling (DHC), ultra-low temperature district heating (ULTDH), and bidirectional fifth generation 5GDHC systems were assessed from technical, economical, and environmental as­ pects. Moreover, the applications of thermal energy storage (TES) and their roles in the future DHC systems were also investigated. The assessment was done by a generalized methodology framework, integrating the future changes, multiple operation scenarios modellings and system design optimizations. Results suggest that in the future low-energy building stock, the increased cooling demand makes the 5GDHC system the most economically attractive choice. In the supply side, with a 50\% share of wind power in the future national grid, the electricity prices can make 5GDHC and ULTDHC either cost-saving or more expensive compared to the central DHC system dependent on if nuclear plants are decommissioned or not. Besides, with increasing power production from VRE, the limited application of TES for active shift of electricity demand is found when a system’s heat-to-power ratio is high. The methodology framework can be applied to similar systems to increase the understandings on system transitions.},

	abstract = {District heating and cooling (DHC) networks, and in particular, the ﬁfth generation of DHC networks, offer great potential in increasing the overall system efﬁciency and reducing CO2 emissions in the heating and cooling of urban districts. Due to the growing complexity of these energy systems, the use of new planning methods, such as the use of dynamic simulation models based on Modelica, becomes more important. However, especially with large, complex thermal networks, there is a high effort for manual model construction and parameterization. For this reason, we present a framework for automated model generation of DHC networks based on simulation models in Modelica written in Python. The core function of the Python framework is to transform a graph representation of a district heating network into a dynamic simulation model. The authors brieﬂy describe the workﬂow and demonstrate its applicability with three different use cases. We investigate the impact of different design decisions, e.g., comparing the difference between central and decentral pumps as well as a combination of both in one network. In addition, we present the results of evaluating the impact of different network temperature levels or pipe insulation compared to the overall energy supplied to the network, leading to the conclusion that the presented framework is capable of reducing the manual effort for performing DHC network simulations with Modelicaand allows to easily perform parameter studies in an early planning phases in the future.},

The paper describes the GreenSCIES concept integrating Mobility, Power and Heat into a Smart Local Energy System (SLES). At the heart of the system is an ultra-low temperature ambient loop network, which permits bi-directional ﬂow within the pipes to allow energy exchange between heating and cooling customers at different times and in different locations, depending on where demand is at any given time. An existing data centre provides the primary source of waste heat for the scheme. Heat pumps in distributed energy centres are utilised to amplify the temperature of the ambient loop to deliver heat in connected buildings. The energy centres integrate heat pumps with building-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and electric vehicle (EV) charging points. The paper provides an overview of the integrated SLES concept, focussing on the heat pump selection and the short and long-term thermal storage options designed for the scheme. The results show that even the smaller constructible ‘New River’ scheme will save 5,000 tons of CO2e annually. This will tend to 100\% as the grid decarbonise further. Therefore, the GS SLES concept applied to urban areas could deliver signiﬁcant carbon emission savings in the UK and elsewhere.},

The vagaries of the energy market associated with climate, political, and social changes entail cross-sectoral integration that can fulfill these national targets. Fifth-generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) is a relatively new concept of district energy systems that features a simultaneous supply of heating and cooling using power-to-heat technologies. This paper presents best practices for developing 5GDHC systems in Sweden to reach a consensus view on these systems among all stakeholders. A mixed-method combining best practice and roadmapping workshops has been used to disseminate mixed knowledge and experience from middle agents representing industry professionals and practitioners. Four successful implementations of 5GDHC systems are demonstrated and the important learned lessons are shared. The best practices are outlined for system planning, system modeling and simulation, prevailing business models for energy communities, and system monitoring. A roadmap from the middle agents’ point of view is composed and can be utilised to establish industry standards and common regulatory frameworks.},

	abstract = {Humankind is entering a novel era of creativity - an era in which anybody can synthesize digital content. The paradigm under which this revolution takes place is prompt-based learning (or in-context learning). This paradigm has found fruitful application in text-to-image generation where it is being used to synthesize digital images from zero-shot text prompts in natural language for the purpose of creating AI art. This activity is referred to as prompt engineering - the practice of iteratively crafting prompts to generate and improve images. In this paper, we investigate prompt engineering as a novel creative skill for creating prompt-based art. In three studies with participants recruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we explore whether untrained participants could 1) recognize the quality of prompts, 2) write prompts, and 3) improve their prompts. Our results indicate that participants could assess the quality of prompts and respective images. This ability increased with the participants' experience and interest in art. Participants further were able to write prompts in rich descriptive language. However, even though participants were specifically instructed to generate artworks, participants' prompts were missing the specific vocabulary needed to apply a certain style to the generated images. Our results suggest that prompt engineering is a learned skill that requires expertise and practice. Based on our findings and experience with running our studies with participants recruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we provide ten recommendations for conducting experimental research on text-to-image generation and prompt engineering with a paid crowd. Our studies offer a deeper understanding of prompt engineering thereby opening up avenues for research on the future of prompt engineering. We conclude by speculating on four possible futures of prompt engineering.},

It has been hypothesized that this is a consequence of implicit multitask learning in language models’ pretraining (Radford et al., 2019). Can zero-shot generalization instead be directly induced by explicit multitask learning? To test this question at scale, we develop a system for easily mapping any natural language tasks into a human-readable prompted form. We convert a large set of supervised datasets, each with multiple prompts with diverse wording. These prompted datasets allow for benchmarking the ability of a model to perform completely held-out tasks. We ﬁne-tune a pretrained encoder-decoder model (Raffel et al., 2020; Lester et al., 2021) on this multitask mixture covering a wide variety of tasks. The model attains strong zero-shot performance on several standard datasets, often outperforming models up to 16× its size. Further, our approach attains strong performance on a subset of tasks from the BIG-bench benchmark, outperforming models up to 6× its size.

	abstract = {Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspeciﬁc datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underﬁts WebText. Samples from the model reﬂect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These ﬁndings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

	abstract = {Understanding the adoption and use of technology is extremely important in the field of information systems. Not surprisingly, there are several conceptual models that attempt to explain how and why individuals use technology. Until recently, however, the role of personality in general, and the five-factor model (FFM) of personality in particular, had remained largely unexplored. Our study takes an interactional psychology perspective, linking components of the FFM to the use of technology within the conceptual framework of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). After empirically confirming previous research findings linking performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence to technology use, we test direct relationships between FFM personality traits and technology use in the context of a webbased classroom technological system, utilizing measures of perceived and actual use of technology. Consistent with expectations, conscientiousness and neuroticism are associated with perceived and actual use of technology, with conscientiousness demonstrating a positive association with both perceived and actual use and neuroticism, a negative association. Extraversion was also significantly associated with actual use, although not in the positive direction expected. Further, the significant relationships between the personality traits and the actual use of technology were direct and not mediated by expressed intentions to use the system.},

As emerging technologies continue to advance, it is imperative to facilitate their proper integration into society, managing expectations and fear. This paper investigates users’ perceptions of generative AI using 3M posts on Twitter from January 2019 to March 2023, especially focusing on their occupation and usage. We ﬁnd that people across various occupations, not just IT-related ones, show a strong interest in generative AI. The sentiment toward generative AI is generally positive, and remarkably, their sentiments are positively correlated with their exposure to AI. Among occupations, illustrators show exceptionally negative sentiment mainly due to concerns about the unethical usage of artworks in constructing AI. People use ChatGPT in diverse ways, and notably the casual usage in which they “play with” ChatGPT tends to associate with positive sentiments. After the release of ChatGPT, people’s interest in AI in general has increased dramatically; however, the topic with the most signiﬁcant increase and positive sentiment is related to crypto, indicating the hype-worthy characteristics of generative AI. These ﬁndings would offer valuable lessons for policymaking on the emergence of new technology and also empirical insights for the considerations of future human-AI symbiosis.},

Abundant evidence also suggests that language plays a developmental role in structuring our learning. Here, we ask: how much of human-like thinking can be captured by learning statistical patterns in language alone? We first contribute a new challenge benchmark for comparing humans and distributional large language models (LLMs). Our benchmark contains two problem-solving domains (planning and explanation generation) and is designed to require generalization to new, out-of-distribution problems expressed in language. We find that humans are far more robust than LLMs on this benchmark. Next, we propose a hybrid Parse-and-Solve model, which augments distributional LLMs with a structured symbolic reasoning module. We find that this model shows more robust adaptation to out-of-distribution planning problems, demonstrating the promise of hybrid AI models for more human-like reasoning.},

Here, we evaluate LLMs using a distinction between formal competence—knowledge of linguistic rules and patterns—and functional competence—understanding and using language in the world. We ground this distinction in human neuroscience, showing that these skills recruit different cognitive mechanisms. Although LLMs are close to mastering formal competence, they still fail at functional competence tasks, which often require drawing on non-linguistic capacities. In short, LLMs are good models of language but incomplete models of human thought.},

Our findings show that ChatGPT is generally viewed as of high quality, with positive sentiment and emotions of joy dominating in social media. Its perception has slightly decreased since its debut, however, with joy decreasing and (negative) surprise on the rise, and it is perceived more negatively in languages other than English. In recent scientific papers, ChatGPT is characterized as a great opportunity across various fields including the medical domain, but also as a threat concerning ethics and receives mixed assessments for education.

Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to undesired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difﬁcult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI’s distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI’s capabilities, 2) AI’s output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these ﬁndings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as the most important breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) that fundamentally transform research and developments in the field. ChatGPT represents one of the most exciting LLM systems developed recently to showcase impressive skills for language generation and highly attract public attention. Among various exciting applications discovered for ChatGPT in English, the model can process and generate texts for multiple languages due to its multilingual training data. Given the broad adoption of ChatGPT for English in different problems and areas, a natural question is whether ChatGPT can also be applied effectively for other languages or it is necessary to develop more language-specific technologies. The answer to this question requires a thorough evaluation of ChatGPT over multiple tasks with diverse languages and large datasets (i.e., beyond reported anecdotes), which is still missing or limited in current research. Our work aims to fill this gap for the evaluation of ChatGPT and similar LLMs to provide more comprehensive information for multilingual NLP applications. While this work will be an ongoing effort to include additional experiments in the future, our current paper evaluates ChatGPT on 7 different tasks, covering 37 diverse languages with high, medium, low, and extremely low resources. We also focus on the zero-shot learning setting for ChatGPT to improve reproducibility and better simulate the interactions of general users. Compared to the performance of previous models, our extensive experimental results demonstrate a worse performance of ChatGPT for different NLP tasks and languages, calling for further research to develop better models and understanding for multilingual learning.},

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classiﬁcations. Our ﬁndings reveal that around 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10\% of their work tasks aﬀected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19\% of workers may see at least 50\% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected eﬀects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Signiﬁcantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15\% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed signiﬁcantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56\% of all tasks. This ﬁnding implies that LLM-powered software will have a substantial eﬀect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.},

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by ﬁne-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to ﬁne-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further ﬁne-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that ﬁne-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

	abstract = {Prompt-learning has become a new paradigm in modern natural language processing, which directly adapts pre-trained language models (PLMs) to cloze-style prediction, autoregressive modeling, or sequence to sequence generation, resulting in promising performances on various tasks. However, no standard implementation framework of prompt-learning is proposed yet, and most existing promptlearning codebases, often unregulated, only provide limited implementations for speciﬁc scenarios. Since there are many details such as templating strategy, initializing strategy, and verbalizing strategy, etc. need to be considered in prompt-learning, practitioners face impediments to quickly adapting the desired prompt learning methods to their applications. In this paper, we present OpenPrompt, a uniﬁed easyto-use toolkit to conduct prompt-learning over PLMs. OpenPrompt is a research-friendly framework that is equipped with efﬁciency, modularity, and extendibility, and its combinability allows the freedom to combine different PLMs, task formats, and prompting modules in a uniﬁed paradigm. Users could expediently deploy prompt-learning frameworks and evaluate the generalization of them on different NLP tasks without constraints. OpenPrompt is publicly released at https://github.com/ thunlp/OpenPrompt.},

Prompting a generative model is a promising recent development that in principle enables end-users to creatively leverage zero-shot and few-shot learning to assign new tasks to an AI adhoc, simply by writing them down. However, for the majority of end-users writing effective prompts is currently largely a trial and error process. To address this, we discuss the key opportunities and challenges for interactive creative applications that use prompting as a new paradigm for Human-AI interaction. Based on our analysis, we propose four design goals for user interfaces that support prompting. We illustrate these with concrete UI design sketches, focusing on the use case of creative writing. The research community in HCI and AI can take these as starting points to develop adequate user interfaces for models capable of zero- and few-shot learning.},

Using natural language to steer LLM outputs (“prompting”) has emerged as an important design technique potentially accessible to non-AI-experts. Crafting efective prompts can be challenging, however, and prompt-based interactions are brittle. Here, we explore whether non-AI-experts can successfully engage in “end-user prompt engineering” using a design probe—a prototype LLM-based chatbot design tool supporting development and systematic evaluation of prompting strategies. Ultimately, our probe participants explored prompt designs opportunistically, not systematically, and struggled in ways echoing end-user programming systems and interactive machine learning systems. Expectations stemming from human-to-human instructional experiences, and a tendency to overgeneralize, were barriers to efective prompt design. These fndings have implications for non-AI-expert-facing LLM-based tool design and for improving LLM-and-prompt literacy among programmers and the public, and present opportunities for further research.},

PromptIDE allows users to experiment with prompt variations, visualize prompt performance, and iteratively optimize prompts. We developed a workflow that allows users to first focus on model feedback using small data before moving on to a large data regime that allows empirical grounding of promising prompts using quantitative measures of the task. The tool then allows easy deployment of the newly created ad-hoc models. We demonstrate the utility of PromptIDE (demo: http://prompt.vizhub.ai) and our workflow using several real-world use cases.},

However, in this study, we show that some AI systems, namely large language models (LLMs), exhibit behavior that strikingly resembles human-like intuition—and the many cognitive errors that come with them. We use a state-of-the-art LLM, namely the latest iteration of OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3.5), and probe it with the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) as well as semantic illusions that were originally designed to investigate intuitive decision-making in humans. Our results show that GPT-3.5 systematically exhibits “machine intuition,” meaning that it produces incorrect responses that are surprisingly equal to how humans respond to the CRT as well as to semantic illusions. We investigate several approaches to test how sturdy GPT-3.5’s inclination for intuitive-like decision-making is. Our study demonstrates that investigating LLMs with methods from cognitive science has the potential to reveal emergent traits and adjust expectations regarding their machine behavior.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating interactive LLMs such as ChatGPT using publicly available data sets. We carry out an extensive technical evaluation of ChatGPT using 23 data sets covering 8 different common NLP application tasks. We evaluate the multitask, multilingual and multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly designed multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with zero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some tasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages than generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual prompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT is 63.41\% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories under logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, hence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive than inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like other LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric memory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the interactive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying LLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8\% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2\% ChrF++ on machine translation, in a multi-turn "prompt engineering" fashion. We also release codebase for evaluation set extraction.},

The public release of ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM), represents a significant step forward in this direction. Accordingly, professionals predict that this technology will affect education, including the role of teachers. However, despite some assumptions regarding its influence on education, how teachers may actually use the technology and the nature of its relationship with teachers remain under-investigated. Thus, in this study, the relationship between ChatGPT and teachers was explored with a particular focus on identifying the complementary roles of each in education. Eleven language teachers were asked to use ChatGPT for their instruction during a period of two weeks. They then participated in individual interviews regarding their experiences and provided interaction logs produced during their use of the technology. Through qualitative analysis of the data, four ChatGPT roles (interlocutor, content provider, teaching assistant, and evaluator) and three teacher roles (orchestrating different resources with quality pedagogical decisions, making students active investigators, and raising AI ethical awareness) were identified. Based on the findings, an in-depth discussion of teacher-AI collaboration is presented, highlighting the importance of teachers’ pedagogical expertise when using AI tools. Implications regarding the future use of LLM-powered chatbots in education are also provided.},

Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through a language model API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets.

	abstract = {Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated remarkable performance on various natural language reasoning tasks. However, it tends to perform poorly on tasks which requires solving problems harder than the exemplars shown in the prompts. To overcome this challenge of easy-to-hard generalization, we propose a novel prompting strategy, least-to-most prompting. The key idea in this strategy is to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. Our experimental results on tasks related to symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning reveal that least-to-most prompting is capable of generalizing to more difﬁcult problems than those seen in the prompts. A notable ﬁnding is that when the GPT-3 code-davinci-002 model is used with least-to-most prompting, it can solve the compositional generalization benchmark SCAN in any split (including length split) with an accuracy of at least 99\% using just 14 exemplars, compared to only 16\% accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting. This is particularly noteworthy because neural-symbolic models in the literature that specialize in solving SCAN are trained on the entire training set containing over 15,000 examples. We have included prompts for all the tasks in the Appendix.},

	abstract = {Large language models are able to perform a task by conditioning on a few input-output demonstrations - a paradigm known as in-context learning. We show that language models can explicitly infer an underlying task from a few demonstrations by prompting them to generate a natural language instruction that fits the examples. To explore this ability, we introduce the instruction induction challenge, compile a dataset consisting of 24 tasks, and define a novel evaluation metric based on executing the generated instruction. We discover that, to a large extent, the ability to generate instructions does indeed emerge when using a model that is both large enough and aligned to follow instructions; InstructGPT achieves 65.7\% of human performance in our execution-based metric, while the original GPT-3 model reaches only 9.8\% of human performance. This surprising result suggests that instruction induction might be a viable learning paradigm in and of itself, where instead of fitting a set of latent continuous parameters to the data, one searches for the best description in the natural language hypothesis space.},

	abstract = {Scaling up language models has been shown to predictably improve performance and sample eﬃciency on a wide range of downstream tasks. This paper instead discusses an unpredictable phenomenon that we refer to as emergent abilities of large language models. We consider an ability to be emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models. Thus, emergent abilities cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models. The existence of such emergence raises the question of whether additional scaling could potentially further expand the range of capabilities of language models.},

	abstract = {Prevailing methods for mapping large generative language models to supervised tasks may fail to suﬃciently probe models’ novel capabilities. Using GPT-3 as a case study, we show that 0-shot prompts can signiﬁcantly outperform few-shot prompts. We suggest that the function of few-shot examples in these cases is better described as locating an already learned task rather than meta-learning. This analysis motivates rethinking the role of prompts in controlling and evaluating powerful language models. In this work, we discuss methods of prompt programming, emphasizing the usefulness of considering prompts through the lens of natural language. We explore techniques for exploiting the capacity of narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions and techniques for encouraging deconstruction of a problem into components before producing a verdict. Informed by this more encompassing theory of prompt programming, we also introduce the idea of a metaprompt that seeds the model to generate its own natural language prompts for a range of tasks. Finally, we discuss how these more general methods of interacting with language models can be incorporated into existing and future benchmarks and practical applications.},
