\chapter*{Abstract}


This thesis adapts the ordered probit model proposed by \citet{hausman1992} to the recent high frequency financial world with IBM transaction price data on the New York Stock Exchange. The simplified model provides consistent findings with the original paper regarding the impact of order flows and trade size on the following price change. The thesis extends the application of the model and evaluates its forecasting ability. However, the mean percentage of correct prediction only ranges between 62-64\%. The forecasting ability even weakens during the crisis periods, i.e., Covid-19 pandemic in 2008 and the financial crisis in 2008.
